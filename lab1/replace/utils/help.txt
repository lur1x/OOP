This application replaces all occurrences of a substring in a text file with another string, and
writes the result to an output file (different from the input).

The program supports three modes of operation:

1. Input via the command line:
replace.exe <input file> <output file> <search string> <replace string>

2. Input via stdin: If the program is launched without parameters, it takes the search string as
the first line, the replacement string as the second line, and then the replacement text.
ma
mama
mama delala pelmeni
ya pokushal plotno
where "ma" is the search string, "mama" is the replacement string, "mama delala pelmeni ya pokushal
 plotno" is the replacement text.

3. Launching the program with the -h parameter displays a brief help on
usage and terminates execution.
