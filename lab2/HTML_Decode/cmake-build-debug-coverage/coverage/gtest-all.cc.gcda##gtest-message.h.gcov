        -:   76://      to the ostream.
        -:   77://
        -:   78:// For example;
        -:   79://
        -:   80://   testing::Message foo;
        -:   81://   foo << 1 << " != " << 2;
        -:   82://   std::cout << foo;
        -:   83://
        -:   84:// will print "1 != 2".
        -:   85://
        -:   86:// Message is not intended to be inherited from.  In particular, its
        -:   87:// destructor is not virtual.
        -:   88://
        -:   89:// Note that stringstream behaves differently in gcc and in MSVC.  You
        -:   90:// can stream a NULL char pointer to it in the former, but not in the
        -:   91:// latter (it causes an access violation if you do).  The Message
        -:   92:// class hides this difference by treating a NULL char pointer as
        -:   93:// "(null)".
